# CS305-Software-Security

## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements.  Who was the client?  What issue did they want you to address? ##

Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations. As a crucial part of the success of their custom software, they also want to use the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a public web interface. They are seeking Global Rain’s expertise in how to protect their client data and financial information.  Specifically, Artemis Financial wants to add a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications. When the web application is used to transfer data, they will need a data verification step in the form of a checksum. You must take their current software application and add secure communication mechanisms to meet their software security requirements. You’ll deliver a production quality integrated application that includes secure coding protocols.

## What did you do very well when you found your client’s software vulnerabilities?  Why is it important to code securely?  What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing? ##

I provided solutions for the vulnerabilities.  It is important to code security to avoid potential problems that might cause a financial or reputational burden.  Software security adds a layer of trust that can attract and retail clients.

## What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? ##

Identifying what was considered a false positive during the dependency check was challenging for me.

## How did you increase layers of security?  In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use? ##

Ways to increase security include restrictions to physical access, input validation, secure API interactions, use of encryption, secure error handling, secure data structures, good maintenance practices, incident response plans.

## How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? ##

In this class, I was asked to run a dependency check that showed known vulnerabilities.  After refactoring the code, the dependency check was run again to ensure that no new vulnerabilities were present.  The code also successfully connected to HTTPS.

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks? ##

The dependency check, hash function, and certificate generation were all tools I had never used before and see myself using the future.

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience.  What might you show future employers from this assignment? ##

Project Two can be found within the Module 7 folder.  I would show how I was able to use the SHA-256 algorithm to encrypt data.
